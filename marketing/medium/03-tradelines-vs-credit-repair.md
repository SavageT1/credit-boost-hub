# Tradelines vs Credit Repair: Which Should Come First?

People often treat tradelines and credit repair like competitors. In reality, they are sequence tools.

## Repair-first is usually better when:
- You have inaccurate negatives
- You have unresolved derogatory errors
- Your report integrity is weak

Why: fixing bad data often removes direct drag before you add profile support.

## Tradelines-first may make sense when:
- Your report is mostly clean
- You need age/utilization support
- Timing matters for a financing window

## Best hybrid approach
1. Correct inaccuracies
2. Lower utilization
3. Add one targeted tradeline
4. Keep payment behavior tight

## Bottom line

Credit repair improves report integrity. Tradelines improve profile structure. In the right order, they can work better together.
