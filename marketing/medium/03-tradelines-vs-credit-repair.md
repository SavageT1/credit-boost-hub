# Tradelines vs Credit Repair: Which Comes First?

People often treat these as competitors. They are better viewed as sequence tools.

## Credit repair first when...

- Your file has inaccurate negatives
- You have duplicate or outdated derogatory data
- You have unresolved collections errors

In these cases, cleanup can remove drag before adding profile support.

## Tradelines first when...

- Your file is mostly clean
- You need stronger age/utilization support
- Timing matters for a financing window

## The best hybrid

- Correct errors
- Stabilize utilization
- Add one targeted tradeline
- Maintain on-time payments and low balances

## Bottom line

Repair improves integrity. Tradelines support profile structure. Used together in the right order, they work better.
