# How Many Tradelines Do You Actually Need?

Most buyers ask this too late. They shop by price first, then try to reverse-engineer results. Better approach: diagnose your profile first.

## There is no magic number

Some people need one targeted line. Others benefit from two. Many overbuy because they skip diagnostics.

## Start with profile categories

- **Thin file, clean history:** often one to two lines can create visible support
- **Moderate file, mixed factors:** one to three based on age/utilization goals
- **Negative-heavy file:** repair-first usually outperforms more tradelines

## Signs you are overbuying

- You cannot explain what each line is fixing
- You are ignoring utilization or payment behavior
- You are expecting tradelines to override active derogatories

## Smart sequencing

1. Pull and review all three reports
2. Fix obvious inaccuracies
3. Improve utilization first
4. Add the minimum tradelines needed for your target

## Final takeaway

Buy strategy, not quantity. One aligned tradeline can outperform several random ones.
