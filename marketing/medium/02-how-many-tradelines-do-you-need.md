# How Many Tradelines Do You Actually Need?

Most people ask this after they already started shopping by price. Better sequence: diagnose first, then buy with purpose.

## There is no magic number

Some people benefit from one tradeline. Others may need two. Many people overbuy because they cannot explain what each tradeline is supposed to fix.

## Practical profile framework

### Thin file + mostly clean report
Often one to two tradelines can create meaningful support.

### Moderate file + mixed factors
Usually one to three, depending on age/utilization goals.

### Negative-heavy file
Repair-first is often a better first move than adding more lines.

## Signs you are overbuying

- You cannot define a target metric
- You are adding lines while utilization is still high
- You expect tradelines to offset unresolved negatives

## Smart sequencing

1. Pull and review all three reports
2. Correct inaccuracies
3. Improve utilization discipline
4. Add the minimum number of targeted lines
5. Reassess before buying more

## Final takeaway

Buy strategy, not quantity. One properly matched tradeline can outperform several random ones.
