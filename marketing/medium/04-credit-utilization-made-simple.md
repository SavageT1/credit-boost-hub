# Credit Utilization Made Simple (and Why It Matters Before Tradelines)

Before buying tradelines, understand utilization. It is one of the fastest-moving credit profile factors.

## Two utilization numbers matter
- **Per-card utilization:** balance vs limit on each card
- **Aggregate utilization:** total revolving balance vs total revolving limits

You can have decent aggregate utilization and still hurt your profile with one maxed card.

## Practical utilization rules
- Keep balances controlled before statement dates
- Avoid high utilization on individual cards
- Build a monthly payment cadence

## Where tradelines fit
Tradelines may support profile structure, but they work best when your own utilization habits are under control.

## Quick action plan
1. List all card limits and balances
2. Identify highest-utilization cards
3. Reduce balances strategically
4. Recheck after reporting cycle

## Final takeaway

Utilization discipline is foundational. Tradelines can amplify a strong base, not replace it.
