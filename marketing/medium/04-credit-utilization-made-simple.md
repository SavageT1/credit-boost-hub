# Credit Utilization Made Simple (and Why It Matters Before Tradelines)

Before people buy tradelines, they should understand utilization. It is one of the fastest-moving score factors.

## Utilization basics

- **Per-card utilization:** balance vs limit on each card
- **Aggregate utilization:** total revolving balance vs total revolving limits

Both matter.

## Practical targets

- Keep aggregate utilization low
- Avoid maxed cards even if aggregate looks okay
- Pay down before statement dates when possible

## Where tradelines fit

Tradelines may help by increasing available revolving structure or age support, but they work best when your own utilization behavior is under control.

## Action plan

1. List every card limit and balance
2. Identify highest-utilization cards
3. Reduce balances strategically
4. Recheck after reporting cycle

## Final thought

Utilization discipline is foundational. Tradelines can amplify a strong foundation, not replace it.
