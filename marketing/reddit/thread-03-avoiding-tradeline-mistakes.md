Title: Biggest tradeline mistake I keep seeing: buying without a profile diagnosis

Body:
Most mistakes are not about the concept. They are about execution.

Common issues:
- Buying based only on price
- Adding too many lines at once
- Expecting tradelines to offset active negatives

Better approach:
- Define your target outcome first
- Identify your weakest profile factor
- Choose the minimum number of lines needed
- Keep utilization and payment behavior tight while waiting for reporting

Would love to hear what frameworks others use to avoid overbuying.
