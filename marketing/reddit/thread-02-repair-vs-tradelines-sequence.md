Title: Credit repair first or tradelines first? Simple sequencing framework

Body:
People ask this all the time. Here is a clean way to think about it:

Start with repair-first if:
- You have reporting inaccuracies
- You have unresolved/incorrect derogatory drag

Tradelines-first may make more sense if:
- Your file is mostly clean
- You need profile support for age/utilization depth

Best hybrid in many cases:
1) Fix inaccuracies
2) Reduce utilization
3) Add one targeted tradeline
4) Track reporting and avoid unnecessary hard pulls

Curious how others prioritize when a financing timeline is involved.
