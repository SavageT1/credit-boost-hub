Title: What authorized-user tradelines can (and cannot) do for your credit profile

Body:
I see a lot of confusion around tradelines, so here is the most practical summary I can give.

What they MAY help with:
- Average age support
- Revolving profile depth
- Utilization structure support

What they do NOT do:
- Remove collections
- Erase late payments
- Guarantee approvals or score jumps

If your file has major negative issues, cleanup usually matters first. If your file is relatively clean but thin, tradelines may be more useful.

Not financial/legal advice—just sharing a framework that helped me think clearly about sequence and expectations.
